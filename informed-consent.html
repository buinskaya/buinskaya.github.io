        <h2>Participation in the Study</h2>
        <h3>Why have I been chosen?</h3>
        <p>You are eligible to participate in this study because you registered on Prolific as a participant, confirmed that you live in the United States, and met the study’s standards for Prolific’s approval rate and the number of previous submissions.</p>
        <h3>Do I have to participate?</h3>
        <p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. If you do decide to participate, you will be asked to agree to this consent form. You are still free to withdraw your consent and participation at any time for any reason without penalty. If you choose to withdraw, your data collected to that point will be deleted. You can withdraw by contacting the research team using the contact information provided below.</p>
        <h3>What will happen to me if I participate?</h3>
        <p>If you decide to participate, we will ask you to play a color-guessing game. After the game, we will ask you a few questions about the game and your decision-making process.</p>
        <p>By its nature, the game contains an element of chance, which may affect the final amount of money you can earn. The element of chance is introduced to simulate real-world decision-making scenarios and is not intended to promote or simulate gambling. However, we recognize that some individuals may have personal, financial, or religious reasons for avoiding activities that resemble gambling. The monetary stakes involved in this game are meant solely for the purpose of this academic research and are not intended for entertainment or gambling purposes.</p>
        <p>If you believe that participating in this study conflicts with your personal beliefs or values, please consider carefully whether you wish to proceed with participation. Participation is entirely voluntary, and you are free to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty.</p>
        <h3>How long will the study take?</h3>
        <p>Most people will complete this study within 30 minutes.</p>
        <h3>How much will you pay me?</h3>
        <p>The compensation you receive for participating in this study can range between $4 and $9, but we expect participants to earn $8 on average.</p>
        <h3>What are the possible disadvantages and risks of participation?</h3>
        <p>We do not anticipate any risks or discomforts from participating in this research.</p>
        <h3>What are the possible benefits of taking part?</h3>
        <p>There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study besides the monetary compensation. However, information from this study will help us better understand people’s decision to share information with or withhold it from their group when the group members’ incentives are aligned.</p>
