        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <h3>TL;DR:</h3>
        <p>You and Player 2 will receive two identical boxes containing 100 blue and red balls. There are 10 more balls of one color than the other, and there is an equal chance that either color is in the majority. <strong>Your goal is to guess the predominant color.</strong> If both players guess correctly, you win and receive an award; if both guess incorrectly, you lose and pay a penalty. Otherwise, it's a draw.</p>
        
        <h3>How the color distribution is determined:</h3>
        <p>At the beginning of each round, you will flip a <button type="button" class="showExplanation" onclick="openIBtn(1)" title="What is a fair coin?">fair</button> coin.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If the coin lands on heads, you and Player 2 will each receive a box containing <strong style="color:#008CBA;">55 blue balls</strong> and <strong style="color:#f44336;">45 red balls</strong>.</li>
        <li>If it lands on tails, your boxes will each have <strong style="color:#f44336;">55 red balls</strong> and <strong style="color:#008CBA;">45 blue balls</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Sampling and guessing:</h3>
        <p>Player 2 will check the color of one ball from their box; there is a 55% chance that it matches the color of their pick matches the majority color.</p>
        <p>You can check the color of any 11 balls in your box. After that, youÂ will have the option to show your picks to Player 2&mdash;it is completely up to you whether to share this information or pass.</p>
        <p>After sampling, players may submit their guesses.</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic">Note: Player 2 is a computer, not a human; however, we programmed it to make the best decision based on all available information.</p>
        
        <h3>Game's objective:</h3>
        <p>Both boxes have the same color distribution, as determined by the coin flip. <strong>The goal of the game is to guess which color&mdash;blue or red&mdash;dominates in your boxes</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Win:</strong> If both you and Player 2 correctly guess the predominant color in your respective boxes, you both win and will receive an award.</li>
            <li><strong>Lose:</strong> If both guess incorrectly, you both lose and will pay a penalty.</li>
            <li><strong>Draw:</strong> If one player guesses correctly and the other does not, the game ends in a draw.</li>
        </ul>
