<main>
<p>In this part, we will ask you a few questions about your experience in the game and your decision-making process. Please answer all questions carefully.</p>

<p>As before, you receive $1 when both players guess the majority color correctly and pay $4 when both players incorrectly is $4. You neither win a bonus nor pay a penalty if players' guesses mismatch.</p>
